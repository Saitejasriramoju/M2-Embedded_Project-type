# Introduction:
It is very necessary to keep our room temperature normal inorder keep our body temperature normal and also most of the medicines as well as house hold items will be in good condition at room temperature beacause they are manufactured within that normal temperature ranges.So inorder to have an idea over our surrounding temperature "Room temperature detector"is important.

# Features:
1.Detects the room temperature and immediately displays value of temperature on tha display.

2.Available in low cost and in smaller sizes.

3.Simple circuit design and easy to understand.

# 4W'S and 1H:
## What?
* It is an display based project which detects the surrounding temperature and gives an awareness over the temperature in which we are presently residing.
## WHY?
* Its a good habit to keep our body temperature normal and also it is very needed for some of the items to be in normal temperatures because they are manufactured for that particular range only so to aware about temperature it is imporatant.
## WHERE?
* We can use it in Medical prone areas ,Houses and also food storing halls.
## WHO?
*  It is an automated detector no need of any manual involvement to reset to normal value so every one who needs can use it.
## HOW?
* A sensor which is the main part of this project and it is the one which detects and displays the value.

# SWOT ANALYSIS:
## Strength:
* Its strength is compact in size and accuracy in displaying the correct temperature.
## Weakness:
* Due to the usage of tiny electronic components need to be very care in handling.
## Opportunity:
* We should create an opportunity to make our product used by everyone by providing an awareness over the adverse effects of over temperatures and importance of surveiling the temperature.
## Threat:
* Most of the mobiles has already these features but we need to prove the importance of this device in each and every embedded projects to get aware.
